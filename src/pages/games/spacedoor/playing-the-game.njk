  <h1>
    Playing the Game
  </h1>
  <p>
    There are two main modes in which you play the game: Exploration and Combat.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Exploration
  </h2>
  <p>
    During Exploration, the GM will describe settings, portray characters, and
    set up challenges or puzzles for the players to overcome. Players can also
    initiate scenes or plan out what they want to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is typically a lower stakes mode of playing, and the rules can be
    played fairly loosely. Most likely you will be making skill checks as
    needed, but for the most part, it's just roleplaying according to what's
    happening in the game.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Combat
  </h2>
  <p>
    Combat is more involved than Exploration, and there's much more order to the
    rules (that's why most of the character upgrades are related to combat). As
    combat starts, each player will roll Initiative to determine the turn order,
    then each player will take their turn and do what they can within the action
    economy.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Action Economy
  </h3>
  <p>
    On a player's turn, they can use an Action, a Bonus Action, and a Reaction.
    If you want to get battle maps involved, you can also include Movement, but
    this game is designed to be a little more theater of the mind, so there
    aren't any specific rules for how far you can move, or what range your
    attacks have, or anything like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most common action is Attack, but there are others that you can access
    by buying them from the <a href="../upgrades">upgrade shop</a>. They will
    often require spending Action Points (AP) to perform them or improve their
    efficacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bonus Actions are typically support actions that can help others or give you
    an extra edge in combat. Reactions are slightly different, as you can use
    them in response to something that happens, even if it isn't your turn. You
    only have one Reaction per round of combat, though, and it resets on your
    turn.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Attacking
  </h3>
  <p>
    Unlike D&D and other similar systems, there is no roll to attack, where if
    you roll poorly, you miss. In this game, you pick a target (or targets) and
    just roll damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    To balance this out, each character has a Damage Threshold (DT). If they are
    dealt less damage than the threshold, then they don't lose any Hit Points
    (HP). If the damage is greater than or equal to their DT, they lose the full
    amount of HP based on the damage.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Saving Throws
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are also offensive Actions other than Attack that work a little
    differently. The mechanics of the Action should be described in the Upgrade
    card for it, but typically the target will need to roll to beat a certain
    difficulty as determined by the aggressor's stats.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, to avoid falling asleep if an enemy is trying to inflict the
    "Asleep" status, a player would need to roll Sharp to beat the aggressor's
    Charm DC.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Healing
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are upgrades that make healing easier, but by default, the way to heal
    during combat is to make a Medicine check (difficulty of 8), then roll your
    Healing dice if you succeed.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Death Saves and Dying
  </h3>
  <p>
    When you reach 0 HP, you are knocked out and cannot perform any Actions,
    Bonus Actions, or Reactions. At the beginning of your turn, you will roll
    your Tough die to determine whether you get better, remain the same, or get
    worse.
  </p>
  <p>
    When knocked out, you are stable. While stable, if you roll the highest
    value of your Tough die, you recover 1 HP and are back in the game. If you
    roll a 1, you enter critical condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    When in critical condition, if you roll your Tough die's highest value, you
    become stable again. However, if you roll a 1, your character will die (that
    may not be the end of it, though, there are plenty of sci-fi ways to bring
    back the dead).
  </p>
  <p>
    On in-between values (neither the highest or lowest values), you remain in
    the same condition, which will buy your allies time to heal you before your
    next turn.
