  <h1>
    Stats and Skills
  </h1>
  <p>
    With the exception of Technobabble, each stat is associated to different
    skills, and some of them affect other aspects of your character, such as
    health and armor class.
  </p>
  <p>
    When asked to make a skill check, you'll roll the dice for the stat related
    to the skill, plus any bonuses you have for that specific skill.

  <h3>
    Cool
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is a combination of speed, reflexes, agility, and your ability to act
    under pressure. This also determines your <abbr title="Armor
    Class">AC</abbr>, which determines how difficult it is to damage you in
    combat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your AC is equal to half of your Cool die's highest value, plus 3. It breaks
    down like so:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="util-text-align-left">Cool Die</th>
        <th scope="col" class="util-text-align-right">AC</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="util-text-align-left">d4</th>
        <td class="util-text-align-right">5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="util-text-align-left">d6</th>

      </tr>

      that wouldn't be obvious from a Perception check.
    </dd>

    <dt>Nature</dt>

  <h3>
    Tough

  <p>
    This is used for raw physical strength and hardiness. It also determines how
    much damage you can take before being knocked out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> is calculated as half your Grit die's
    highest value, plus 7. It breaks down like so:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="util-text-align-left">Tough Die</th>
        <th scope="col" class="util-text-align-right">HP</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

      </tr>

    </dd>

    <dt>Intimidation</dt>

  <h3>
    Technobabble
  </h3>
  <p>
    Technobabble is unique in that it doesn't have any specific skills
    associated with it, but you can use your Technobabble die for any other
    skill checks as long as you are using advanced technology to assist your
    efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you are using an advanced healing device to make a Medicine
    check, you could roll your Technobabble die instead of your Cool die.
