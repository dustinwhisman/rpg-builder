    Stats and Skills
  </h1>
  <p>
    Here are the core stats and their associated skills. Sometimes you will be
    asked to roll dice for a stat, but sometimes you will roll for a specific
    skill instead. In that case, you'll roll the dice for the stat associated to
    that skill, then add any extra dice or bonuses that you have for that skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    Skills can be upgraded in a variety of ways in the <a href="../upgrades">upgrade shop</a>.
