    Character Creation
  </h1>
  <p>
    Creating a character is designed to be very simple, so you can get up and
    running quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Choosing a Character Concept
  </h2>
  <p>
    The possibilities are endless for your character. You can be human, alien,
    robot, ghost, or whatever you can possibly dream up in an infinite universe.
    Are you a civilian or are you in the military? Are you from Earth? Did you
    used to serve the enemy? How did you get recruited to be part of the
    Spacedoor program?
  </p>

  <h2>
    Setting Your Stats
  </h2>
  <p>
    Your character has five core stats, which will determine how good or bad
    they are at certain skills. You will need to assign each skill a dice with a
    different number of sides â€“ your choices are d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. The
    more sides on the dice, the better your character is at that stat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stats are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Charm</li>
    <li>Cool</li>
    <li>Sharp</li>
    <li>Tough</li>
    <li>Technobabble</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can <a href="../stats-and-skills">read more about stats and skills</a> to
    inform your choices, but it's better to choose stats that make sense for
    your character concept than trying to optimize everything.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Secondary Stats
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once you've set your core stats, you can fill in some secondary stats that
    are calculated from your core stats.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> is half of your Tough die's highest
      value, plus 7
    </li>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> is half of your Cool die's highest
      value, plus 3
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    An Example Character
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's say we wanted to play as a character that shoots first and asks
    questions never. Right away, that implies maximum Tough, so let's set that
    to a d12.
  </p>
  <p>
    They're probably not super smart or tech-savvy, so let's give them low
    values for Sharp and Technobabble, maybe a d6 and d4, respectively. That
    leaves Cool and Charm. It probably makes sense to make Charm lower for this
    character, so let's set Charm as a d8 and Cool as a d10.
  </p>
  <p>
    That leaves our stats like so:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Charm: d8</li>
    <li>Cool: d10</li>
    <li>Sharp: d6</li>
    <li>Tough: d12</li>
    <li>Technobabble: d4</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And based on that, their HP will be 13, and their AC will be 8. We did it!
    We now have a perfectly playable character whose stats fit with their
    overall concept.
