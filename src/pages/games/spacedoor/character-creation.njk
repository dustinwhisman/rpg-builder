    Character Creation
  </h1>
  <p>
    Creating a character is designed to be very simple, so you can get up and
    running quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Choosing a Character Concept
  </h2>
  <p>
    The possibilities are endless for your character. You can be human, alien,
    robot, ghost, or whatever you can possibly dream up in an infinite universe.
    Are you a civilian or are you in the military? Are you from Earth? Did you
    used to serve the enemy? How did you get recruited to be part of the
    Spacedoor program?
  </p>

  <h2>
    Setting Your Stats
  </h2>
  <p>
    Your character has {{ stats.length }} core stats, which will determine how
    good or bad they are at certain skills. You will need to assign each stat a
    dice with a different number of sides. The more sides on the dice, the
    better your character is at that stat.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      The stats are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Charm</li>
      <li>Cool</li>
      <li>Sharp</li>
      <li>Tough</li>
      <li>Technobabble</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      And the dice are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      {% for dice in baseDice %}
        <li>
          {{ dice }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can <a href="../stats-and-skills">read more about stats and skills</a>
    to inform your choices, but it's better to choose stats that make sense for
    your character concept than trying to optimize everything.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Secondary Stats
  </h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the core stats, you will need to rank how good your character
    is at Offense, Defense, and Healing. Where you rank these will determine
    some stats/dice used in combat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where you rank Offense will determine your Damage Die, which can be a d4,
    d6, or a d8. For Defense, you're determining your Damage Threshold, which
    will be either 2, 4, or 6. For Healing, you're determining your Healing Die,
    which will be either d4, d6, or d8.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Calculated Stats
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once you've set your core stats, you can fill in some calculated stats. If
    you do this on the site, you shouldn't have to worry about it. It should
    just show up on your character sheet.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your Hit Point (HP) max is half of your Tough die's highest value, plus 7.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each stat will have a Difficulty Class (DC) which is half of the stat
      die's highest value, plus 2. DCs are used to set the difficulty that
      enemies need to try to beat.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are a variety of <a href="../status-effects">status effects</a> and
    <a href="../damage-types">damage types</a> that you can encounter in the
    game. When creating your character, choose 3 that you are vulnerable to, 2
    that you are resistant to, and 1 that you are immune to.
  </p>

  <h2>
    An Example Character
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's say we wanted to play as a character that shoots first and asks
    questions never. Right away, that implies maximum Tough, so let's set that
    to a d12.
  </p>
  <p>
    They're probably not super smart or tech-savvy, so let's give them low
    values for Sharp and Technobabble, maybe a d6 and d4, respectively. That
    leaves Cool and Charm. It probably makes sense to make Charm lower for this
    character, so let's set Charm as a d8 and Cool as a d10.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      That leaves our stats like so:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Charm: d8</li>
      <li>Cool: d10</li>
      <li>Sharp: d6</li>
      <li>Tough: d12</li>
      <li>Technobabble: d4</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    For our secondary stats, lets put Offense as best, Healing as worst, and
    Defense in the middle. That will give them a d8 Damage Die, a d4 Healing
    Die, and a Damage Threshold of 4.
  </p>

  <p>
    And based on that, we can figure out our calculated stats. Since their Tough
    is a d12, they will have 13 HP to start with. Since their Charm is higher
    than their Sharp, we'll use that to get their AP max, which will start at 3.
    And since their Cool is a d10, their DT is 4.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      It also means we have the following DCs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Charm: 6</li>
      <li>Cool: 7</li>
      <li>Sharp: 5</li>
      <li>Tough: 8</li>
      <li>Technobabble: 4</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    Let's make them vulnerable to the Berserk status, Psychic damage, and Water
    damage, since those could be fun to roleplay. For resistances, let's make
    them resistant to the Stunned status and Poison damage. And let's make them
    immune to Bludgeoning damage, since they're so tough as it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    We did it! We now have a perfectly playable character whose stats fit with
    their overall concept.
