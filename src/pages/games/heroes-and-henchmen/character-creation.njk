    Character Creation
  </h1>
  <p>
    Creating a character is designed to be very simple, so you can get up and
    running quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Choosing a Character Concept
  </h2>
  <p>
    Since this a game about superheroes, you'll need to decide a few things for
    your character's backstory. What power or powers do you have? Or are you
    just a normal person with gadgets or training? What's your superhero alias?
    Secret identity? What's your origin story? Do your friends and family know
    about your powers/exploits?
  </p>

  <h2>
    Setting Your Stats
  </h2>
  <p>
    Your character has six core stats, which will determine how good or bad they
    are at certain skills. You will need to assign each skill a dice with a
    different number of sides â€“ your choices are d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.
    The more sides on the dice, the better your character is at that stat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stats are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fight</li>
    <li>Flight</li>
    <li>Brains</li>
    <li>Brawn</li>
    <li>Grit</li>
    <li>Charm</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can <a href="../stats-and-skills">read more about stats and skills</a> to
    inform your choices, but it's better to choose stats that make sense for
    your character concept than trying to optimize everything.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Secondary Stats
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once you've set your core stats, you can fill in some secondary stats that
    are calculated from your core stats.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> is half of your Grit die's highest
      value, plus 7
    </li>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Armor Class">AC</abbr> is half of your Flight die's highest
      value, plus 3
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    An Example Character
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's say we wanted to play as a character that has super speed. Right away,
    that implies that Flight is probably their best stat. We'll give that a d20.
  </p>
  <p>
    They're probably not super strong, so let's give them low values for Brawn
    and Grit, maybe a d4 and d6, respectively. That leaves Fight, Brains, and
    Charm.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where the character concept comes into play. Depending on what we
    want our character to be like, we can prioritize different things. There's
    definitely an argument for super speed being useful in a fight, but maybe we
    want them to rely more on social skills, or maybe part of the super speed
    includes reading really fast, so they're really smart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's go with a quippy fighter, and set Charm as d12, Fight as d10, and
    Brains at d8. That leaves our stats like so:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fight: d10</li>
    <li>Flight: d20</li>
    <li>Brains: d8</li>
    <li>Brawn: d4</li>
    <li>Grit: d6</li>
    <li>Charm: d12</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And based on that, their HP will be 10, and their AC will be 13. We did it!
    We now have a perfectly playable character whose stats fit with their
    overall concept.
